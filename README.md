Task
Create a web application that uses firebase for authentication. Once after the authentication is successful, add a page with all the crypto contracts (tokens listed in Pi42) with their live pricing coming from Pi42 web socket. Check out the browser network tab to filter out websocket data. Typescript/Golang is preferred. If you are comfortable in any strongly typed language, that is fine as well. We use typescript(nestjs/nextjs) on our stack and upcoming modules are being built in Golang.

After creating the live ticker price page, add a functionality to sort the data based on 24 hour change percentage. The data should be updated through websocket in real time in the same way how do you see data on pi42.com trade screen. The page should have columns as below.
